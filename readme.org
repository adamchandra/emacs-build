* Building emacs
** Add system deps
#+begin_src bash

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxpm-dev libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libx11-dev libncurses5-dev automake autoconf texinfo libgtk2.0-dev gcc-10 g++-10 libgccjit0 libgccjit-10-dev libjansson4 libjansson-dev

#+end_src


***  The "trick" here is to add ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r as the version of libgccjit shipped with Ubuntu 20.04 won't work for with Emacs native compilation.


** Clone repo and switch to correct branch

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/flatwhatson/emacs.git emacs-arch
git checkout pgtk-nativecomp
cd emacs-arch
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-10 CXX=/usr/bin/gcc-10
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-dbus --with-gif --with-jpeg --with-png --with-rsvg --with-tiff --with-xft --with-xpm --with-gpm=no --with-xwidgets --with-modules --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-json CFLAGS="-O3 -mtune=native -march=native -fomit-frame-pointer"
#+end_src


**  Compilation
The final step is to compile Emacs. It will take very long as it needs to compile Emacs plus all the elisp code to native code. This step will only compile the elisp code that is part of Emacs, and not your own elisp code that is part of your configuration (we'll do that later).

make -j2 NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1

The -j2 part is to tell the compiler how many cores to use for the compilation. You can adjust here depending on your own hardware. Nevertheless it will take a long time.
